# eldritch-text-injector

Given a a normal string input as found in `input.txt` that is a single line a new markdown file will be generated
with non-standard ASCII characters injected into an otherwise unhinged list of statements made by Agile managers (most likely).

Both the input `input.txt` and `eldritch.txt` files can be modified to your (despondent and broken) heart's content.

## usage

```
> python setup.py develop
> python run_text.py
```

If you want to see the compiled examples, simply push them back to your feature branch on this repo.
